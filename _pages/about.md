I'm a computational social scientist working at the intersection of NLP/LLMs, political communication and political methodology. I study explanations of political events. I analyze the differences between causal and noncausal information, and _how_ causal information affects people's understanding of real-world events, and vice versa.

I'm also interested in AI for social sciences. I study LLM capabilities for social science questions.

I'm currently a last year PhD Researcher at the [Hertie School's](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) Data Science Lab, via [SCRIPTS Cluster of Excellence](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/index.html). Previously, I completed an MSc in Methodology at the LSE.
