I'm a computational social scientist working at the intersection of NLP/LLMs, political communication and political methodology. I study explanations of political events. I analyze the differences between causal and noncausal information, and _how_ causal information affect people's understanding of real world events, and vice versa.

For my PhD I developed [PolitiCAUSE](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.1124/), a corpus and language model that identifies causes and effects in politics text. I use both LLMs and traditional NLP techniques in my research. I also use experimental methods to test the effects of causal language construction on people's political understanding.

I'm currently a last year PhD Researcher at the [Hertie School's](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) Data Science Lab, via [SCRIPTS Cluster of Excellence](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/index.html). Previously, I completed an MSc in Methodology at the LSE.
